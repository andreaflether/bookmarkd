> Since Twitter only provides a single page to keep **all** your bookmarked tweets and usually, it takes forever to find a specific tweet in the middle of it all, extreme measures had to be taken. So, i present to you...

**Bookmarkd**! With it, you can create as many folders as you want and add the tweets of your choice, by just pasting the tweet link :)

## Main features
### üìÇ Save tweets of your choice in folders (a.k.a. Bookmark Folders)
Create folders by adding a name and a description. After that, just start adding tweets to it! The bookmarks will always be displayed in the order they were last added.
### üåì Dark and Light mode
The default is the Dark mode, but you can change the application mode at any time. 
### üî¢ Sort folders by Name, Last Update or Number of Bookmarks
The folders in the index page, by default, are sorted by the date they were last updated at, but you can also sort them by Name or by the Number of Bookmarks.
### ‚úã No repeated bookmarks
Bookmarkd will tell you if the tweet you're trying to add already exists in the current folder.
### üìå Pin folders
You can also pin a folder. They will always appear first in the index page.
### üë©‚Äçüíª  Sign up via Bookmarkd or Twitter
It is possible to create an account on the site or log in via Twitter.
### üîí Private bookmarks
Only you have access to your folders/bookmarked tweets.
